1. Source of Life

- The environment provides essential resources like air, water, food, and shelter that sustain all living beings.

- Natural ecosystems regulate the balance necessary for life, such as oxygen production through plants and the water cycle.

2. Supports Biodiversity

- A healthy environment maintains diverse ecosystems, ensuring the survival of various species.
  Biodiversity contributes to resilience against environmental changes and offers resources for food, medicine, and innovation.

3. Regulates Climate

- The environment influences global weather patterns and climate stability.
  Forests, oceans, and other ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating climate change.

4. Ecosystem Services

- Nature provides ecosystem services such as pollination of crops, soil fertility, flood control, and water purification.

- These services are essential for agriculture, industry, and everyday life.

5. Cultural and Recreational Value

- The environment enriches human life through its aesthetic, spiritual, and recreational significance.

- Natural landscapes inspire art, culture, and traditions and offer places for relaxation and adventure.And you well see our project about the environment !
