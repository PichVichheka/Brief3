- Natural ecosystems regulate the balance necessary for life, such as oxygen production through plants and the water cycle.

2. Supports Biodiversity

- A healthy environment maintains diverse ecosystems, ensuring the survival of various species.
  Biodiversity contributes to resilience against environmental changes and offers resources for food, medicine, and innovation.

3. Regulates Climate

- The environment influences global weather patterns and climate stability.
  Forests, oceans, and other ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating climate change.

4. Ecosystem Services
